1. our challenge was in finding how to access the dom in the current page through the chrome extension.
2. figuring how to traverse through the nodes in order to find the elements that were text only
   1. we ended up using innertext
3. replacing images was harder as the srcset was overwriting the dom manipulation we were doing
